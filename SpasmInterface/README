README file for the `SpasmInterface' GAP4 package
        
To get the latest version of this GAP 4 package pull the corresponding branch from github. 

This package requires a working installation of the software `Spasm' on your computer. Currently, only part of the functionality of Spasm is supported by this interface.

The latest version of Spasm can be downloaded from https://github.com/cbouilla/spasm. However, please note that by default Spasm will ignore empty rows when computing left kernels. At times this is not desired. Indeed, for the purposes of this package it is indeed expected, required and desired to take empty rows (and columns) into account when computing left (or right) kernels of matrices. Therefore, I provide in my fork of this repository at https://github.com/HereAround/spasm a branch martin_devel, which modifies this behaviour:
(1) It extends the .gitignore file such that even after the following installation process, all newly created files are being ignored by git.
(2) It modifies /bench/kernel.c such that zero rows are taken into account when computing kernels.
(3) It modifies /bench/rank_dense.c such that its output is recognized by gap.
Currently, a successsful installation of this interface requires that you have this version of Spasm - provided by the branch 'martin_devel' - installed on your system.

To install this software, clone this git-repository by

git clone https://github.com/HereAround/spasm

Then cd into the spasm folder and switch to and pull the branch martin_devel by

git checkout -b martin_devel
git pull origin martin_devel

Next create a ./configure file. This file is currently (20/01/2020) not included in the above-mentioned git repository. To create it, on Ubuntu 18.04 the following commands had to be issued (inside the Spasm folder):

aclocal
autoconf
autoreconf --install

For a quick installation you can simply issue

./configure
make
sudo make install

Note that the last command needs roots rights to be able to write libraries and header files to /etc/usr. 

At times it is advantageous to not install software in /usr/etc, e.g. to clearly separate such installs from the system software. This can be achieved by configuring with options. A complete list of these options is available via ./configure --help. Among them is the --prefix option. This allows to install the software spasm in a predefined path.

Let us assume that the spasm folder is located at /home/spasm and that we decide to store all build libraries and header files in /home/spasm/build. For this to happen let us first issue

./configure --prefix=/home/spasm/build

Now issue

make
make install

The second command now writes to /home/spasm/build an thus does not require root rights.

Whilst this successfully installs spasm, this gap-package will not yet be functional, as it will not be able to locate this installation of spasm. To fix this perform the following:

(1) Start gap  
(2) Load SpasmInterface by issuing "LoadPackage( "SpasmInterface" );"
(3) Issue "SetSpasmDirectory( "/home/spasm/bench" );"

Note that we have added the subfolder /bench to the location of spasm. This subfolder contains the scripts which this interface triggers. This completes this customized installation.

More details/information on how to install spasm can be found in the spasm package. E-mail me if there are any questions, remarks, suggestions. Also, I would like to hear about applications of this package.
