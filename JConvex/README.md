# JConvex
A `Gap4` package to do convex geometry by `Polymake` in `Julia`. This package is key to make the functionality of the `ToricVarieties_project` available in `Julia`.


## Installation this package

To get the latest version of this GAP 4 package pull the corresponding branch from github. This completes the installation of this package.


## Documentation and test

You can create the documentation for this package by issuing `make doc` inside the JConvex folder. Provided a running LaTeX installation, the documentation will subsequently be available inside the /doc subfolder as manual.pdf. After this step, you can also issue a test on this software by issuing `make test`.
