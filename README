README file for the `TopcomInterface' GAP4 package
        
To get the latest version of this GAP 4 package pull the corresponding branch from github. 

This package requires a working installation of topcom on your computer. To this end download the latest version from
http://www.rambau.wm.uni-bayreuth.de/TOPCOM/

The installation of this software typically means to perform the following steps inside the Topcom folder:

./configure CFLAGS="-m64" CXXFLAGS="-m64"
make
make check
make install
make clean

More details/information can be found in the topcom package. This completes the installation of this gap-package.

Currently, some functionality is not yet supported. In particular, this include the command line options -d, -h, -v, cardinality[k], frequency[ k ] and the input-type "chiro".

E-mail me if there are any questions, remarks, suggestions. Also, I would like to hear about applications of this package.
