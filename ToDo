Functions which involve "chiro" are currently not functional (typically unable to Eval the string)
-> Input format seems to be more flexible than currently anticipated
-> Fix this and add examples/tests for these functions also

Note that EvalString also fails if not triangulation is found. This definitely needs to be fixed.

Also, the command line options are more flexible than so-far anticipated - we may have "--..." but also "-..." can be used. This is currently not supported either.

Currently, Topcom produces lots of output in the console, which is not nice when using gap. Can this be adjusted?

ToricVarieties should not be a required package.
