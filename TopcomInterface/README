README file for the `TopcomInterface' GAP4 package


(1) Installation
--------------------------

To get the latest version of this GAP 4 package pull the corresponding branch from github. 

This package requires a working installation of topcom on your computer. To this end download the latest version from
http://www.rambau.wm.uni-bayreuth.de/TOPCOM/

The installation of this software typically means to perform the following steps inside the Topcom folder:

./configure CFLAGS="-m64" CXXFLAGS="-m64"
make
make check
make install
make clean

More details/information can be found in the topcom package. This completes the installation of this gap-package.

Currently, some functionality is not yet supported. In particular, this include the command line options -d, -h, -v, cardinality[k], frequency[ k ] and the input-type "chiro".


(2) Documentation and test
--------------------------

You can create the documentation for this package by issuing

gap makedoc.g

After this step, you can also issue a test on this software by issuing
