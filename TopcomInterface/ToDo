- Currently, Topcom produces lots of output in the console, which is not nice when using gap. 
  => To alter this we need to adjust the actual topcom implementation
- Docu not yet nice output too large
- Make full functionality of topcom accessible. In particular support command line options -d, -h, -v, cardinality[k], frequency[k]...
=> Thereby reproduce and test all examples in the topcom documentation
- Add gap-category wrappers for chiros and points used as input and output for topcom
- Banner upon loading which says "based on topcom" or alike
