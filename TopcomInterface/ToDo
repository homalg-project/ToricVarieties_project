- Make full functionality of topcom accessible. In particular support command line options -d, -h, -v, cardinality[k], frequency[k]...
=> Thereby reproduce and test all examples in the topcom documentation.
- Add gap-category wrappers for chiros and points used as input and output for topcom.
- Banner upon loading which says "based on topcom" or alike would be nice.
