The *ToricVarieties_project* aimes for high performance algorithms to compute sheaf cohomologies of coherent (toric) sheaves.


## Package list

Package|Description
------|-----------
[ToricVarieties](ToricVarieties)|Support for toric varieties in gap.
[AdditionsForToricVarieties](AdditionsForToricVarieties)|Additional algorithms for toric varieties (soon to be joined with the toric varieties package)
[cohomCalgInterface](cohomCalgInterface)|An interface to [cohomcalg](https://github.com/BenjaminJurke/cohomCalg)
[TopcomInterface](/TopcomInterface)|An interface to [topcom](http://www.rambau.wm.uni-bayreuth.de/TOPCOM/)
[SpasmInterface](/SpasmInterface)|An interface to [spasm](https://github.com/cbouilla/spasm)
[SparseMatrices](/SparseMatrices)|Elemtary support for sparse matries. This packages uses [SpasmInterface](/SpasmInterface)
[TruncationsOfFPGradedModules](/TruncationsOfFPGradedModules)|We model coherent sheaves a f.p. graded modules via [FreydCategories](https://github.com/homalg-project/CAP_project/tree/master/FreydCategoriesForCAP). This package installs truncations for these modules.
[ToolsForFPGradedModules](/ToolsForFPGradedModules)|This package installs constructors for ideals, minimal free resolutions, Betti tables but also conversion of our f.p. graded modules into other module formats employed throughout the [homalg_project](https://github.com/homalg-project).
[CoherentSheavesOnToricVarieties](/CoherentSheavesOnToricVarieties)|This package models coherent sheaves as objects in a Serre quotient category of f.p. graded modules.
[SheafCohomologyOnToricVarieties](/SheafCohomologyOnToricVarieties)|Implementation of fast algorithms for the computation of sheaf cohomologies of coherent (toric) sheaves. The algorithms are described in my [PhD thesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08860). These algorithms have been used in the context of [F-theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-theory) in the article [1706.04616](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04616).
[H0Approximator](/H0Approximator)|This package is the result of recent collaboration with [Mirjam Cvetič](https://live-sas-physics.pantheon.sas.upenn.edu/people/standing-faculty/mirjam-cvetic), [Ron Donagi](https://www.math.upenn.edu/~donagi/), [Ling Lin](https://theory.cern/roster/lin-ling), [Muyang Liu](https://github.com/lmyreg2017) and [Fabian Rühle](https://github.com/ruehlef). The preprint is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00009).
[QSMExporer](/QSMExporer)|This package is the result of recent collaboration with [Mirjam Cvetič](https://live-sas-physics.pantheon.sas.upenn.edu/people/standing-faculty/mirjam-cvetic) and [Muyang Liu](https://github.com/lmyreg2017). The preprint is be available on the arxiv [2104.08297](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08297).


## Installation

Detailed instructions for the installation can be found [here](https://martinbies.github.io/software/). For Ubuntu and Debian systems, I provide an installation script, with attempts to set up all of the above packages. This script is available [here](https://martinbies.github.io/Install.sh). *This script is outdated. Update very soon.*
